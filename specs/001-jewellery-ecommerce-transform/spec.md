# Feature Specification: Jewellery E-commerce Transformation

**Feature Branch**: `001-jewellery-ecommerce-transform`
**Created**: 2026-04-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Transform the Capella monorepo into a premium jewellery e-commerce platform, matching the aesthetics, UX, and functionality of Samra. Includes Stripe payments (AED ), enhanced product data (badges, jewellery attributes), premium search overlay, and luxury design system."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Premium Storefront Experience (Priority: P1)

A customer visits the jewellery storefront and immediately perceives a
luxury brand through refined typography, generous spacing, and a
monochrome palette. While browsing product listings, the customer sees
products with prominent badges ("NEW", "BESTSELLER", "LIMITED EDITION"),
can hover over product images for a smooth zoom effect, and can save
favourite items with a heart icon overlay. The entire experience feels
premium, fast, and elegant.

**Why this priority**: The visual and interactive transformation is the
foundation of the brand. Without it, every other feature ships inside a
generic-looking storefront that undermines the premium positioning.

**Independent Test**: Navigate the homepage and a collection page. Verify
that headings use serif typography, the palette uses only #f4f4f4/#ffffff/
#000000, product cards display badges, images zoom on hover, and the
heart icon saves items to favourites.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a product assigned a "NEW" badge, **When** the customer views
   the product card on any listing page, **Then** the "NEW" badge is
   displayed prominently without obscuring the product image.
2. **Given** a product card in a grid, **When** the customer hovers over
   the product image, **Then** the image smoothly zooms in with a
   transition effect, and a heart/wishlist icon appears as an overlay.
3. **Given** the customer clicks the heart icon on a product card,
   **When** the action completes, **Then** the product is added to the
   user's favourites list (or guest session) and the icon reflects the
   saved state.
4. **Given** the storefront is viewed in Arabic (RTL), **When** the
   layout renders, **Then** all typography, spacing, badges, and card
   interactions mirror correctly in right-to-left orientation.
5. **Given** the storefront is viewed on mobile, **When** the customer
   taps and holds a product image, **Then** the zoom effect activates
   via touch interaction.

### User Story 2 - Premium Predictive Search (Priority: P1)

A customer clicks the search icon and a full-width overlay appears with
a smooth fade/slide transition. Before typing, the overlay shows
"Trending Now" products pulled from analytics. As the customer types,
predictive results appear instantly with large product images, names,
prices, and highlighted matching terms. The overlay also shows
"Recent Searches" retrieved from the customer's previous sessions.
Results are visually rich with clear hierarchy.

**Why this priority**: Search is the primary discovery mechanism for
jewellery. A premium, predictive search directly impacts conversion by
helping customers find specific pieces quickly.

**Independent Test**: Open the search overlay. Verify trending products
appear before typing. Type a query and confirm predictive results with
images appear. Close and reopen to verify recent searches persist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the customer clicks the search icon, **When** the search
   overlay opens, **Then** it expands to full-width with a smooth
   animation and displays trending products.
2. **Given** the search overlay is open with no query, **When** the
   customer has previous searches, **Then** "Recent Searches" are
   displayed and persisted across sessions.
3. **Given** the customer types a search query, **When** at least 2
   characters are entered, **Then** predictive results appear with
   product images, names (EN/AR), prices in AED , and matching terms
   highlighted.
4. **Given** the customer submits a search, **When** the query executes,
   **Then** the system searches across product names, descriptions,
   SKUs, and metadata to return relevant results.
5. **Given** the search overlay is open, **When** displayed in Arabic
   (RTL), **Then** the overlay layout, text direction, and result
   ordering are fully mirrored.

### User Story 3 - Secure Stripe Checkout (Priority: P1)

A customer adds items to cart and proceeds to checkout. The customer is
redirected to a Stripe-hosted Checkout page for payment, with all prices
displayed in AED . After payment, the customer is redirected back to an
order confirmation page with order details. If payment fails, the customer
returns to an error page with a clear message and can retry without losing
cart data.

**Why this priority**: Payment is the revenue moment. Without a working
checkout flow, the platform cannot generate sales.

**Independent Test**: Add products to cart, proceed through checkout,
complete payment via Stripe (test mode), and verify the order success
page displays correct details. Then test a failed payment scenario.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer with items in cart, **When** they proceed to
   checkout, **Then** the system creates a Stripe checkout session with
   all line items priced in AED .
2. **Given** a completed Stripe payment, **When** the webhook confirms
   the session, **Then** the order status is updated to "PAID" and the
   customer is redirected to an order confirmation page.
3. **Given** a failed Stripe payment, **When** the customer returns
   from Stripe, **Then** they see a clear error page, the cart is
   preserved, and they can retry checkout.
4. **Given** the Stripe webhook receives an event, **When** the event
   is processed, **Then** the system verifies the webhook signature
   before updating any order data.
5. **Given** a guest customer completes checkout, **When** payment
   succeeds, **Then** the order is linked to a guest account and a
   confirmation is sent to the provided email.

### User Story 4 - Jewellery Product Management (Priority: P2)

An admin opens the CMS and creates a new jewellery product. They can
assign a product badge (NEW, BESTSELLER, LIMITED EDITION), mark it as
trending, and specify jewellery-specific attributes such as Material
(18K Gold, White Gold, Platinum), Stone (Diamond, Emerald, Ruby,
Sapphire), and Clarity (VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2). They can also manage
collection hero banners with custom images and text for visually
distinct collection pages.

**Why this priority**: Rich product data enables the premium storefront
experience (badges, trending products, refined search). Without it,
the storefront has nothing premium to display.

**Independent Test**: Create a product in the CMS with a badge, trending
flag, and jewellery attributes. Verify the data appears correctly on
the storefront. Then create a collection banner and verify it renders
on the collection page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin creates or edits a product, **When** they access
   the product form, **Then** they can select a badge from the options:
   NEW, BESTSELLER, LIMITED EDITION, or none.
2. **Given** an admin creates or edits a product, **When** they toggle
   the trending flag, **Then** the product appears in trending sections
   on the storefront and search overlay.
3. **Given** an admin manages product attributes, **When** they add
   jewellery-specific attributes, **Then** they can define Material,
   Stone, and Clarity at the product level (shared across all variants),
   while Color and Size remain variant-level attributes.
4. **Given** an admin edits a collection, **When** they upload a hero
   banner image and add text, **Then** the collection page displays the
   banner prominently at the top.
5. **Given** the CMS is displayed in Arabic, **When** the admin manages
   products or collections, **Then** all labels, badges, and attribute
   names appear in Arabic with correct RTL layout.

---

### User Story 5 - Search Analytics & Trending (Priority: P2)

An admin views analytics in the CMS and sees search-related data:
most searched terms, products appearing most in results, and
click-through rates. The trending products endpoint uses this data to
surface the most popular items in the search overlay when no query is
entered.

**Why this priority**: Analytics provide actionable insights for
merchandising. Trending products create a dynamic storefront without
manual curation.

**Independent Test**: Perform several searches on the storefront. Open
the CMS analytics page and verify search terms, result counts, and
click data are recorded. Verify trending products update based on
search and click activity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer performs a search, **When** the query is
   submitted, **Then** the system records the search term, result
   count, and timestamp.
2. **Given** a customer clicks a search result, **When** the product
   detail page loads, **Then** the system records the click-through
   with the originating search query.
3. **Given** the trending endpoint is called, **When** sufficient
   search data exists, **Then** the system returns products ranked by
   search frequency and click-through rate.
4. **Given** an admin views the analytics dashboard, **When** they
   navigate to search analytics, **Then** they see top search terms,
   zero-result queries, and trending products with counts.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a Stripe webhook is received out of order or
  duplicated?
  → Webhook processing is idempotent, keyed on the Stripe session ID.
  Already-processed events are skipped, preventing duplicate order
  status updates.
- How does the system handle a product with both a badge and trending
  flag — do they visually conflict on the product card?
- What happens when search returns zero results — does the overlay show
  suggestions or trending products as fallback?
- What happens when a product variant has jewellery attributes but
  another variant of the same product does not?
  → Jewellery attributes are product-level, so all variants inherit
  the same Material/Stone/Clarity. This scenario cannot occur.
- How does the system handle checkout when a product goes out of stock
  between adding to cart and completing payment?
  → Stock is validated at checkout session creation and again at webhook
  confirmation. If unavailable at either point, the checkout is rejected
  or the payment is refunded, and the customer is notified.
- What happens when the Cloudinary-hosted collection banner image fails
  to load?
- How does the search overlay behave when the customer switches between
  Arabic and English mid-session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support product badges (NEW, BESTSELLER,
  LIMITED EDITION) on products, visible on all product card displays.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support a trending flag on products that
  surfaces them in the search overlay and homepage sections.
- **FR-003**: System MUST expand the attribute system to support
  jewellery-specific attributes: Material, Stone, and Clarity, each
  with bilingual (EN/AR) names. These attributes MUST be defined at the
  product level (shared across all variants), while Color and Size
  remain variant-level.
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate with Stripe standard business
  accounts for payment processing, locked to AED  currency.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a checkout endpoint that creates a
  Stripe-hosted Checkout session (redirect mode) with all cart items
  priced in AED . Stock MUST be validated before session creation; if any
  item is unavailable, the checkout MUST be rejected with a clear
  message.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a webhook endpoint that processes
  Stripe payment events and updates order status accordingly. Stock
  MUST be re-validated at webhook processing; if an item became
  unavailable, the payment MUST be refunded and the customer notified.
  Webhook processing MUST be idempotent, keyed on the Stripe session
  ID, to safely handle duplicate or out-of-order events.
- **FR-007**: System MUST verify Stripe webhook signatures before
  processing any payment event.
- **FR-008**: System MUST display an order confirmation page after
  successful payment and an error page with retry option after failed
  payment.

  with smooth open/close animations.
- **FR-010**: System MUST display trending products in the search
  overlay when no query is entered.
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist and display recent searches across
  user sessions.
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide predictive search results as the
  customer types, searching across product names, descriptions, SKUs,
  and metadata.
- **FR-013**: System MUST track search analytics including query terms,
  result counts, and click-through rates. Raw search events MUST be
  retained for 90 days; daily aggregations MUST be retained indefinitely.
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide a trending products endpoint ranked
  by search frequency and click activity.
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement a luxury design system with serif
  headings, sans-serif body text, and a monochrome palette
  (#f4f4f4, #ffffff, #000000).
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide hover-to-zoom interaction on product
  card images with smooth transitions.
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide a heart/wishlist icon overlay on
  product cards for quick saving.
- **FR-018**: System MUST support collection hero banners with custom
  images and text manageable from the CMS.
- **FR-019**: All new user-facing content MUST support Arabic (AR) and
  English (EN) translations.
- **FR-020**: All new frontend layouts MUST handle RTL (right-to-left)
  natively for Arabic.

### Key Entities

- **Product Badge**: An enum (NEW, BESTSELLER, LIMITED EDITION) that
  labels a product for visual emphasis on cards and listings.
- **Jewellery Attribute**: Typed attributes (Material, Stone, Clarity)
  with bilingual values assigned at the product level, shared across all
  variants. Material covers precious metals, Stone covers gemstone types,
  and Clarity covers grading scales. Color and Size remain variant-level
  attributes.
- **Collection Banner**: A hero section with image, heading, and
  description (bilingual) attached to a collection for a visually
  distinct landing experience.
- **Search Analytics Event**: A record of a search query, including the
  term entered, number of results returned, and any product clicked from
  the results.
- **Payment Session**: A Stripe-hosted Checkout session (redirect mode)
  linked to an order, tracking the payment lifecycle from creation
  through completion or failure. Customer card data never touches the
  platform — Stripe handles all payment UI.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Customers perceive the storefront as a premium luxury
  brand, verified by the design system consistently applying serif
  headings, monochrome palette, and generous spacing across all pages.
- **SC-002**: Product cards display badges, zoom on hover, and wishlist
  icons with zero visual glitches or layout shifts on desktop and
  mobile.
- **SC-003**: The search overlay opens and displays trending results
  within 1 second of activation.
- **SC-004**: Predictive search results appear within 500ms of the
  customer typing each character.
- **SC-005**: Customers complete the full checkout flow (cart to order
  confirmation) without encountering unhandled errors or losing cart
  data.
- **SC-006**: 100% of Stripe webhook events are processed with
  signature verification, and order statuses update correctly.
- **SC-007**: All new content (badges, attributes, banners, search UI)
  is fully translated and displays correctly in both English and Arabic
  RTL layouts.
- **SC-008**: Search analytics capture at minimum the query term, result
  count, and click-through product for every search interaction.

## Assumptions

- The existing product, variant, and order data models are stable and
  will be extended, not replaced.
- The existing authentication and user system will be reused as-is.
- Cloudinary is already configured for media management; new banner
  images will use the existing upload pipeline.
- Stripe API keys (test and live) will be provided by the product owner
  via environment configuration.
- Product badge and trending flag data will be managed exclusively
  through the CMS by admin users.
- Jewellery attributes (Material, Stone, Clarity) will use the same
  pattern as existing Color/Size attributes, extended with bilingual
  names.
- The existing favourites/wishlist system will be reused for the heart
  icon on product cards.
- The existing analytics event tracking will be extended for search
  analytics rather than replaced.
- Search analytics data retention: raw events retained for 90 days,
  daily aggregations retained indefinitely, following the existing
  analytics aggregation pattern.
- Collection banners are optional — collections without banners will
  render with the current default layout.
